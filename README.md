# MX Key PCB

This is your first PCD Designer Exam, so we'll keep it simple.

You will create a simple PCB with 3 MX Key (mechanical Keyboard) and an USB connector to connect to the PC and have programmable shortcut key.

For the exam you have access to Internet and Wiki from IUT LONGWY GITHUB, Library and Drawing.

**Don't forget to make a Document (in french) to explain all the steps of the Design, I will use this document and the Eagle files to rate you. So keep it clear and complete.**

**Send everything in a .RAR file at captant.mickael@gmail.com BEFORE the end of the exam**

You have 4 hours, good luck !

## Dimensions

![Screenshot](https://github.com/Starius-Project/Eagle_examen_1/blob/master/docs/drawing_screenshot.jpg)

All dimensions are in mm.

You need to respect the position of CHERRY MX KEY and USB.

Add 4 holes on the side for M3 screws.



## Components

To make this design you need the following components:
- CHERRY-MX-LED from cherry MX library
- ATMEGA32U4 from Adafruit library
- all the necessary components around (only use 0805 components for resistors and capacitors)
- USBMINIB from Adafruit library

## Different Steps

you must validate the different steps by calling the teacher before continuing the following tasks:

- found components and place on the schematic
- Connect them with Net and Net Name
- synchronize with the PCB
- change dimensions of the PCB (based on drawing)
- place main components on the PCB (USB, Cherry Key, ATMEGA based on drawing)
- place other components
- route tracks and place VIA for GND + place GND Polygon (one BOTTOM and one TOP)
- place Serigraphy
- Send files
